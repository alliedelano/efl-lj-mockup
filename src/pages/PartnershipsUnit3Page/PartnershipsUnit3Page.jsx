                    <h3>Assessing Readiness for Employer Engagement and Building Powerful Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>The aim of this resource is to help you to assess your
                    school/college readiness for employer engagement
                    and powerful partnerships so you can build better
                    relationships, in turn offering opportunities for employers
                    to engage with your organisation that are clear,
                    intentional and sustainable. Building strong sustainable
                    relationships will also help UK schools/colleges achieve

                    careers, 5. Encounters with employers and employees
                    and 6. Experiences of the workplaces.</p>
                    <p>Once your school or college has reached out to
                    employers, or vice versa, it is important there is a clear
                    idea of how, when and who the employer can engage
                    with. How this is managed and activity and outcomes are captured and reported. To build sustainable relationships
                    with employers you need to establish a mutual
                    understanding of how your relationships are structured
                    and how they will function to achieve the main goal that
                    working effectively together will significantly improve
                    student and community outcomes. It is also essential
                    you are very clear about your ’ask’ to the employer,
                    Ofsted’s ‘Getting Ready for Work’ report highlights
                    the importance of this to ensure intentional employer
                    engagement happens in schools and colleges.</p>
                    <p>Before you start to plan it is important you assess the
                    readiness of the school/college and your employers
                    to ensure your engagement and partnerships are
                    successful.</p>
                    <h3>Assessing the Employers Readiness</h3>
                    <h4>Part 1: Readiness indicators for an Employer</h4>
                    <p>As part of your outreach it is important to ask key
                    questions to help you understand your employer’s
                    readiness and capacity to engage in a powerful
                    partnership. Doing so will help ensure there’s a deep
                    understanding of the employer’s motivation to engage
                    and their level of commitment including their capacity to
                    build a strong relationship with sustainable engagement.</p>
                    <p>As part of your outreach, there are three key categories
                    you should be exploring with a prospective employer
                    partner.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Breadth of organisational involvement, commitment, motivation and priorities.</li>
                        <li>Experience working with education.</li>
                        <li>Experience hosting/collaborating with students and teachers (onsite & remotely).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span className="bold">You can assess each category using a simple Observation Rubric Tool (LINKED AND INCLUDED BELOW AS A RESOURCE)</span></p>
                    <h4>Part 2: Listen and Learn</h4>
                    <p>To really explore an entire organisation’s readiness and
                    capacity requires active listening skills. You will never
                    discover all you are seeking to learn in one conversation.
                    Typically, it requires a series of conversations that
                    each time go a bit deeper. With each conversation you
                    develop more of a relationship with greater levels of
                    appreciation and understanding.</p>
                    <p>Through your conversations you might discover that
                    an organisation has room for all types of opportunities.
                    They might want to continue doing their light
                    touch engagement, continue engaging in certain
                    opportunities/subjects or strategically dedicate a part
                    of the organisation to powerful partnerships and offer
                    deeper engagement. You won’t know the outcome or
                    the degree to which this organisation is interested in
                    educational partnerships until you ask the right questions
                    and truly listen.</p>
                    <p>Here is a series of example questions you might explore
                    during conversations with employer leaders and
                    management. Remember, your goal is to understand
                    their readiness and capacity to engage in a powerful
                    partnership or simply engage in outreach activities on
                    a less strategic level. You won’t know the outcome or
                    the degree to which this organisation is interested in
                    educational partnerships until you ask the right questions
                    and truly listen.</p>
                    <h3 className="key-tip">KEY TIP: The information you gather here is imperative for the
                    relationship you start to build with the employer and how
                    deep the partnership can venture.</h3>
