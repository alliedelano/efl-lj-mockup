                    <h3>Assessing Readiness for Employer Engagement and Building Powerful Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>The aim of this resource is to help you to assess your
                    school/college readiness for employer engagement
                    and powerful partnerships so you can build better
                    relationships, in turn offering opportunities for employers
                    to engage with your organisation that are clear,
                    intentional and sustainable. Building strong sustainable
                    relationships will also help UK schools/colleges achieve
                    Gatsby Benchmarks 2. Learning from career and labour
                    market information, 4. Linking curriculum learning to
                    careers, 5. Encounters with employers and employees
                    and 6. Experiences of the workplaces.</p>
                    <p>Once your school or college has reached out to
                    employers, or vice versa, it is important there is a clear
                    idea of how, when and who the employer can engage
                    with. How this is managed and activity and outcomes are captured and reported. To build sustainable relationships
                    with employers you need to establish a mutual
                    understanding of how your relationships are structured
                    and how they will function to achieve the main goal that
                    working effectively together will significantly improve
                    student and community outcomes. It is also essential
                    you are very clear about your ’ask’ to the employer,
                    Ofsted’s ‘Getting Ready for Work’ report highlights
                    the importance of this to ensure intentional employer
                    engagement happens in schools and colleges.</p>
                    <p>Before you start to plan it is important you assess the
                    readiness of the school/college and your employers
                    to ensure your engagement and partnerships are
                    successful.</p>
                    <h3>Assessing School/College Readiness</h3>
                    <h4>Part 1: Readiness Indicators for School/College teams including Senior Leadership Team</h4>
                    <p>Your school/college assessment should focus on answering a variety of key questions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What's in place that will help set up a partnership for success (structures, roles, schedules, developed your 'ask' etc.)?</li>
                        <li>What's already happening partnership-wise?</li>
                        <li>Are teachers/staff engaging with partnerships? If so, with what intensity?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The school/college assessment gathers information
                    helpful to a successful partnership kick-off. That way,
                    the employer and the school/college are entering into
                    the relationship at the best possible starting place given
                    their readiness indicators and capacity to engage.</p>
                    <p>The below topics are recommended starting points to
                    listen for, learn from, and ask questions about when
                    assessing your school/college. Doing so will help you
                    gain a deeper understanding regarding how and to what
                    degree you are capable of partnering with business and
                    community organisations. Are they fully prepared and
                    committed to going significantly beyond the occasional
                    guest speaker or the annual careers event?</p>
                    <h4>The broad topics to consider in depth include:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Extent and sustainability of leadership support, provision of resources, and existing structures.</li>
                        <li>Current level of experience with partnership activities.</li>
                        <li>Experience with collaboration and a continuous improvement mind-set.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You can assess each topic using a simple Observation Rubric Tool (RESOURCE LINKED AND INCLUDED BELOW), or you can adapt this for your organization.</p>
                    <h4>Part 2: Listen and Learn</h4>
                    <p>You will need to ask questions in order to really know
                    what exists, what should be in place, and how you can
                    support the school/college to develop sustainable
                    employer engagement and powerful partnership
                    success. It will also inform what Continuous Professional
                    Development is required across the school/college.</p>
                    <h3 className="key-tip">KEY TIP: Always ensure your teachers feel valued and included
                    throughout the assessment process and during
                    engagements. Communicate regularly and a simple
                    ‘Thank You’ goes a long way.</h3>
                    <div className="sample-questions">
                        <h4 >Example questions you may want to explore:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What instructional approaches and experiences have teachers used in the past? Have these been
                            implemented in individual classrooms or as an integrated approach (across multiple classrooms) for
                            your students to experience?</li>
                            <li>What have been teacher’s experiences with both in and out of the classroom (and virtual), work-based
                            learning experiences for students? What have they learned along the way?</li>
                            <li>Describe the current structure of the subject teachers and the format for collaboration among teachers.</li>
                            <li>Describe the types of professional development the teachers have been provided in order to deepen
                            their capacity around successful practices that are part of the partnership activities.</li>
                            <li>To what degree has the business community been involved with your school/college (not just with the
                            career and vocational teachers, but also with the teachers who teach core subjects)?</li>
                            <li>Is the organisation within your building structured in such a way that it reinforces the ongoing touch
                            points needed for building and maintaining powerful partnerships with employers? How often do you
                            meet with teachers? How often have you met as a team along with your business partners?</li>
                            <li>What is the relationship between the teachers and the “outreach team/colleague” (careers lead/
                            business engagement lead) in terms of having a strategic approach to partnerships? How do the
                            teachers and the careers lead/business engagement lead collaborate and communicate around
                            successes, challenges, and sharing of partnership results (data)?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Assessing Students Readiness</h4>
                    <p>Just as you are preparing the employers and the
                    teachers to engage in powerful partnerships, students
                    need to be ready too.</p>
                    <p>Ask yourself what’s currently in place (or should be in
                    place) to support students in order for them to have
                    more touch points and opportunities with employer
                    partners? When transitioning their experiences to those
                    that powerful partnerships provide, students will have a
                    foundation of experience, attitudes, and preconceptions.
                    Discovering and filling any gaps in that foundation
                    is essential to grow the outreach programme with
                    employer partners.</p>
                    <h4>When assessing readiness across the organisation be inclusive, include diversity of students</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Newly enrolled students</li>
                        <li>Graduating students and/or alumni</li>
                        <li>Students representing a range of abilities, interests, and grade levels</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The best way to undertake this assessment is through
                    a combination of individual meetings, site observations,
                    and student focus groups. The following categories and
                    definitions will help you assess the readiness of a group
                    of students and then use their input to guide what is
                    done for ALL the students in the school/college</p>
